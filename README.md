1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
  1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, this is because it will catch the issues early and automatically without the programmer having to do much work.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
  No because using unit tests are a much better option.

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
  Navigation tests full load cycle, performance and loading behavior and is basically an entire overview of the page performance while snapshots tests the current DOM state which is useful for static checks

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
  We could optimize and properly size the images, add a <meta name="viewport"> tag and also minify the javascript.
